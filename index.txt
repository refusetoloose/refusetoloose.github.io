About me

I‚Äôm a data-driven problem solver with experience in business analysis, consulting, and analytics and I back that up with results.

I‚Äôve delivered impactful projects across energy forecasting, housing trends, nonprofit strategy, and CRM change management. At Accenture, I supported enterprise banking systems by managing 100+ JIRA tickets, writing user stories, and facilitating UAT in Agile teams.

My technical toolkit includes:
  ‚Ä¢ Data & Visualization: Power BI, Tableau, SQL, Excel
  ‚Ä¢ Programming & Modeling: Python, R, Jupyter, Machine Learning
  ‚Ä¢ Testing: Selenium, Manual/Automation, UAT
  ‚Ä¢ Collaboration & Design: JIRA, Confluence, Figma

I balance analytical thinking with stakeholder engagement and have maintained a 4.0 GPA across two post-diploma programs. As an international student, I‚Äôve developed resilience, leadership, and cross-functional teamwork.

I‚Äôm currently open to full-time opportunities in Business Analysis, Data Analytics, or Consulting.
Available immediately under a 3-year Canadian PGWP (no sponsorship required).

In my free time, I enjoy gaming, exploring new tech tools, and working on mini side projects that fuel my creativity and curiosity.

ü§ù Let‚Äôs connect
I‚Äôm always open to collaboration, innovation, and solving meaningful problems together.
